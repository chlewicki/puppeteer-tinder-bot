# Puppeteer Tinder Bot
Log in to Tinder, swipe everyone to the right. You don't even have to touch your phone!

## Build Setup
This Tinder Bot uses your Facebook account to login to Tinder webapp. You are also going to need Node.js and NPM.
  
### Step 1
Change file `env.sample` to `.env`  
Replace values inside with your Facebook credentials and your desired location (Google will help you with that, by default the bot will try to hook you up in a beautiful city in Austria)

### Step 2
Open terminal  

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ npm i

# run the app
$ node sex_app
```
